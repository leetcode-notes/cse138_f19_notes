Trip report!

Peter's on the Baskin Council for Diversity/Inclusion/Equity
- bug him about that
- his students are rad
- 2FA woes

consistent hashing a timesink
- still doin' it w/ virtual nodes
- regular hashing

Consensus:
- have to trick outside observer
- 

Things:
View stamp replication
PaxOS - easier to teach?
Raft  - also a thing?

Agreement:   If a node decides X, all decide X (safety)
Validity:    X must have been proposed (safety)
Termination: ends evetually

FLP impossibility (Fisher-lynch-patterson)
- impossible sometimes with only one process crashing
  - under async protocol
- can circumvent with random algorithm. somehow?
  - randomness harder to make correct

Gossip/anti-entropy
- pick random peers to talk to
- hard to break consistently, which makes peter sad

Leader protocols/failure detection
- doesn't care if there's two for a bit

2Phase commit
- put in box, wait for ack
  - then do second half when asked?
- also layer with reliable deliver
