Protocol: rules of communication
- infinitely many runs of the protocol. (probably exceptions but those would be boring)
note: distance is meaningless on Lamport diagrams, ordering most important
-might be different for physical clocks.
Anomaly: property violation.

FIFO: messages received in the order they sent
- If process P sends M1 before M2, M1 is received before M2

totally-ordered delivery: FIFO between everyone?
 
Causal broadcst algorithm:
on send, increment
on receive, deliver if +1. If too high, buffer
