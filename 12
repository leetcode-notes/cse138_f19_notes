Last lecture on midterm

Network partitions:
- some part of the network can't talk to another part
- what if two halves each elect their own primary
- how we fix
If partitions are inviolate, no inconsistency can be witnessed
- thus, bad things when partitions can fix themselves

Partitions are under the omission model.

Note that oracles might be partitioned. Or everything else might be!

Total Partition: two sub-networks formed
Partial Partition: some computers can't talk to each other.
- partial worse than total: someone might notice they don't talk to each other

Consistency: looks like one computer from the outside <- safety
Availability: responds timely <- liveness
Partition tolerance: behaviour is defined for partitions. *

Pick two.

Since we're distributed, partition is an auto-pick
(so it's between consistency/availability)

PB or CR is CP: goes down.

QR is AP/CP 
- might want a wrong answer over none (youtube)
- might want a correct answer or nothing (banking)

Zookeeper oracle: keeps track of server stats.
- strongly consistent ( what if it's partitioned? no answer)

PaxOS! It's a thing

Want majorities such that between any two majorities their is a common member

State Machine Replication (SMR) will talk about later

K-version programming: bunch of people do the same thing differently and one of them'll work!
