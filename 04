New person! Lindsey

Happens before ( -> ) definition
- on same process line aand before
- if a->b and b->c then a->c
- if a is send M1 and b is receive M1, a->b

Clocks! Physical vs Logical
- can be timekeeping (physical) or operation-#-keeping (logical)
- time-of-day clocks with leap hours/days are complicated
  - screws up duration checking
- cloudflare 2016 bug, leapsecond bug?
- monotonic clocks strictly increasing
  - python 3, import time, time.monotonic. # ms since restart
  - bad for marking points in time, good for durations
- use logical for relative ordering, time of day for individual points

Lamport Clock: LC()
- if a->b, LC(a) < LC(b)
- increment at each event and pass along with messages
* Schwartz and Mattern paper for diagram. 
  Detecting Causal Relationships in Distributed Systems: in Search of the Holy Grail
- Can figure out a->b so !a->!b (also with lamport clocks)

Vector Clocks
* Papers:
  Friedemann Mattern, 1988
  Colin Fidge, 1988
- LC for each process?
- each process has a spot in the vector
- if not strictly comparable they're concurrent/independent
