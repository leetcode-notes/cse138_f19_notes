i. consistency
- weaker models than causality - "session guarantees" per Doug Terry
  - will always see own writes, but maybe not others

Multi-object consistency

Paxos is expensive in:
0 implentation time, it's complicated
1 network, it sends lots of messages
2 timewise, 2RTT most of the time (1 in multipaxos)

Lamport says that Paxosis inveitable.
Vive La Difference, paper

Nontermination still an issue. Might take forever.
Paxos is CP
- consistent, partition-tolerant

How does paxos maintain consistency?
- total order
- SMR

"as I argued until I was blue in the face and am now like psyche..."

How to do strong consistency without total order?
- just total order over operations in the same kinda domain
- ex: x = 1, y = 1: doesn't matter which happens first

total order over all conflicting operations

functional programming immutability property
- patterns easier to reason about conflicts

knowing when consensus has to be a thing

aka: when to make it with blockchain and when not to

R : eval function
S : sequential specification
D : ??? presumably consistent runs

R(S) -> all possible runs of S
- possiblity space thing, possible outcomes.

if R(D) is a subset of R(S), then strong consistency

Consistency models

Smaller outcome space is easier to reason about, stronger consistency constrains more

Which consistency model to use? Depends! Popular consensus changes

eventual consistency: if you don't poke it everything will be consistent

Someone says causal is the strongest consistency model still available.
- alvaro sez so far

causal: can read the cause of things

effect w/o cause: miracle?

also have enough information to know that the cause can't be found..
