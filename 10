Midterm a week from Wednesday. Actually already started.

How to know when failure chance is independent?

Commit point = when reads return writes
View - Oracle keeps track of who's who. Oracle can be distributed.

Addressing - who's primary?
- Oracle tells client everything (doesn't scale)
- DNS Recursive routing - Backup could proxy primary.
- DNS iterative routing - Backup redirects client to primary

Multiple requests
- How to keep track of each of them?
  - just deliver each after commit point
- Use FIFO

Performance
- How many messages?
- Latency: client-perceived wait time
  - depending on distribution, average latency can be meaningless.
  - "every time I do a vanity search on my name..."
  - Netflix aims at 99th percentile latency: what's the longest wait?
- throughput: information/time
  - transactions per second

Layer FIFO under Primary Backup (PB)
- then math latency: RTT + longest backup write/ack

How to find Expected value of max(N binomial distributions)? (could just simulate)

 why not 1 big computer? because better protocol?

Chain replication:
send message along to each
- tail is commit point
- has to go through each
Chain has better throughput but poorer latency
