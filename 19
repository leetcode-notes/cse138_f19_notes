Paxos/multi-paxos/SMR/globally-ordered FT logs
- Fault tolerant

Multipaxos typically used for globally ordered log

Want to be able to read from any node and get the same answer
"There's a hard thing to do with paxos that has very little to do with paxos"

Deterministc algorithm might still depend on random outcomes, such as message delay/who crashes
- there is a universe of possible executions

Grad scholars paper: Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Why not wait for everyone? Someone might be down.
- Have to wait for majority b/c quorum
  - don't have to wait for more, again might be down.
 

Note to self:
 Crash: alvaro with a hammer
 Omission: alvaro with an eraser
 Error: alvaro with a pencil too
 Byzantine: alvaro, but he could be anyone

Mutlipaxos, accepting many in order:
- agree on one dude to agree on things
- so only have to prepare once to figure out the entire log

Making Paxos, Practical. Praxos/Paxtical?
Phases:
 1) Prepare: check if anyone else proposed or got accepted
    - review state machine response
    - check if higher number
(note that there's a leader election so we can say there's probably only one leader)

2) Figure things out: propose

3) Do 2) until a higher number is gotten back, then stop. (otherwise still leader so lead)

Raft is a thing. Paxos but simpler. Re: there's a fancy webpage about it.
- start with trying to get a log?
- notes that paxos with iteratively proven
Paxos -> MultiPaxos -> There's a log
what if "->" introduces bug?? bad!!

Last seven minutes of class? Strong consistency!

Why commit point? ordering

Durability: tell people it's ok and it is
