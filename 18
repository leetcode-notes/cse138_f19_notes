PaxOS solves consensus
- except it might take forever

proposal numbers monotonically increasing and unique
- broadcast prepare message
  - all acceptors respond back

Acceptors have to store 3 things
- What's my accepted value?
  = and the proposal number
- What's the biggest number seen?

ALGORITHM

P (proposer) and A (acceptor)

P: Pick proposal number N, broadcast Prepare(N)
A: If n > minProposal (bigger than max), return(AV, AN)
P When majority, if AV != upside-down T
  Broadcast Accept(n, value)
A: Return MP, current max proposal number
P: Did any return not our number? Then we're doomed.
