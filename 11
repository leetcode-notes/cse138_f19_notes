Materials! Can bring paper + pens

Latency - measured in time.
Throughput - measured in transactions/operations

Goodput? What is it?
- amount of useful work?
- protocol overhead may or may not be considered.
- maybe necessary work?
  - badput: unnecessary work

Resilency: 
- how many faults can happen?
- how fast can it recover?
  MTTR: Mean Time to Recover

Reliability/Availability:
- uptime ~= availability
- reliability is %chance system is up.
  - some never work, so graph spikes at start
  - then decreases:
   ___
  /   \---___ <--- graph

Can derive uptime from EV[errors%] * MTTR
MTBF: Mean time between failures

Uptime = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)

Recovery oriented computing: things are easy to fix?
- fix via restarts, make restarts fast

Byte-addressible non-volatile memory:
- DIMM slot, byte addressable.
- Survives power-off
- No power cost

Chain replication
- Strong consistency: est. by the primary
- total order: how to order the reads?
  - head orders writes, tail orders reads

PB
- what if message 2 is received after message 1 but has a commit point

Quorum replication
- all nodes are equal
- fat clients: they are used for computing
- not strongly consistent
- partition tolerance

N = # replicaes
W = # of acks req. (quorum) for successful write
R = # of acks req. for reads

Can tailor for consistency or availability.
